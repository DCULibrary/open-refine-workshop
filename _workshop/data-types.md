There are five data types in OpenRefine:
* Text
* Number
* Date
* Boolean
* Array

### Working with Dates
OpenRefine tends to default to seeing content as text. But you can turn them into these other data types. This project has a data field which is actually being treated as a string. With a transform we can tell it that this is a date
* On the `Date` column use the dropdown menu to select `Edit cells -> Transform`
* In `Expression` box type `value.toDate("dd/MM/yyyy")` and press `OK`
Note how the values are now displayed in green and follow a standard convention for their display format (ISO 8601) - this indicates they are now stored as `date` data types in OpenRefine. We can now carry out functions that are specific to Dates
* On the `Date` column dropdown select `Edit column->Add column based on this column`. Using this function you can create a new column, while preserving the old column
* In the New column name type `Formatted Date`
* In the ‘Expression’ box type the GREL expression `value.toString("dd MMMM yyyy")`

### Arrays
An _array_ is a list of values or strings that can be reordered or manipulated. They only come into play when performing transformations. Arrays cannot be stored in a cell in OpenRefine. In GREL it is the `split` function which creates an array (similar to the way we split cells earlier).
* Go to `subject` column
* `Edit cells > Transform...`
* `value.split("|").sort().join("|")`

So that didn't quite work as planned. And I think it’s because it’s case sensitive.
So I’ll try and fix that
* `value.split(“|”).join(“ | “).toTitlecase()`
* `value.split(“ | ”).sort().join(“|”)`
* `value.split(" | ").sort()`
