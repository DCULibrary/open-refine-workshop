### Installing OpenRefine

#### Windows
* OpenRefine is downloaded as a zip file. To install, Unzip the downloaded file wherever you want. This can be to a personal directory or to an applications or software directory - OpenRefine should run wherever you put the unzipped folder. The location should be a “local” drive as problems have been reported trying to run OpenRefine from a Network drive.

#### Mac
* OpenRefine is downloaded as a ‘dmg’ (disk image) file which you can open and then drag the OpenRefine application to an appropriate folder on you computer.

### Running OpenRefine:
Navigate to the folder where you've installed OpenRefine and do one of below depending on your system:
* __Windows__: double-click either ’openrefine.exe’ or ‘refine.bat’

* __Mac__: click the OpenRefine icon

* __Linux__: type ‘./refine’ in a terminal window

__Note: OpenRefine runs in your browser but is not supported by Internet Explorer. Please use Firefox, Chrome or Safari instead.__

The interface to OpenRefine is accessed via a web browser. When you run Refine normally this should open a window in your default web browser pointing at the address http://127.0.0.1:3333. If this doesn’t happen automatically you can open a web browser and type in this address.
