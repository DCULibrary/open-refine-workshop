### What is Open Refine and what is it for?
> __A power tool for working with messy data__

OpenRefine is:
* More powerful than a spreadsheet
* More interactive and visual than scripting
* More experimental/playful than a database

_David Huynh, OpenRefine creator_

It can be used for different kinds of data but OpenRefine is most useful where your data is in tabular format but which has or may have internal inconsistencies. These inconsistencies could be in data formats, where data appears, or in terminology used. OpenRefine can be used to standardize and clean data across your file. It can help you:
* Get an overview of a data set
* Help you split data up into more granular parts, for example splitting up cells with multiple authors into separate cells
* Match local data up to other data sets, for example in matching local subjects against the Library of Congress Subject Headings
* Enhance a data set with data from other sources

Some common scenarios might be:

* Where you want to know how many times a particular value (name, publisher, subject) appears in a column in your data
* Where you want to know how values are distributed across your whole data set
* Where you have a list of dates which are formatted in different ways, and want to change all the dates in the list to a single common date format. For example:

### What is messy data? And why should you clean it?

Data that needs cleaning is often called messy data - it is data that is inconsistent or poorly structured in some way.

Typically you’ll clean your data because you’re going to do something else with it. Maybe to visualise it or present it in some way, or to analyse or draw conclusions from it. Cleaning your data will help ensure any work or outputs based on the dataset is accurate and reliable.

[//]: # (There can be a concern that it cleaning data may remove complexity and variations which are important in and of themselves. In their article [_Against Cleaning_](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-f2acf72c-a469-49d8-be35-67f9ac1e3a60/section/07154de9-4903-428e-9c61-7a92a6f22e51) Trevor Mu&#241;oz and Katie Lawson identify the term data _cleaning_ as problematic rather that the process itself which is (or should be) very much human-led. And that is true with OpenRefine: it is very useful software to bring things to the surface and find out if action is required for reliable analysis or visualisation, but the processes involved in data cleaning is transparent and controlled rather than automated.)

### Some examples

Dates may be in different formats:

| Data you have    | Desired Data |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| 1st January 2014 | 2014-01-01   |
| 01/01/2014       | 2014-01-01   |
| Jan 1 2014       | 2014-01-01   |
| 2014-01-01       | 2014-01-01   |

Names of people or places may be misspelt or not capitalised:

| Data you have    | Desired Data |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| London           | London       |
| London]          | London       |
| London,]         | London       |
| london           | London       |

Or you might have lots of information bundled together that you might want in a more granular layout.

For example, you may want to get from address data like this:

| Address in single field	|
| :---------------------- |
| University of Wales, Llyfrgell Thomas Parry Library, Llanbadarn Fawr, ABERYSTWYTH, Ceredigion, SY23 3AS |
| University of Aberdeen, Queen Mother Library, Meston Walk, ABERDEEN, AB24 3UE	|
| University of Birmingham, Barnes Library, Medical School, BIRMINGHAM, West Midlands, B15 2TT |
| University of Warwick, Library, Gibbett Hill Road, COVENTRY, CV4 7AL |

to something more like this:

| Institution	             | Library                        | Address 1         | Town/City   | Region        | Postcode |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ---------|
| University of Wales	     | Llyfrgell Thomas Parry Library | Llanbadarn Fawr   | Aberystwyth | Ceredigion    | SY23 3AS |
| University of Aberdeen   | Queen Mother Library           | Meston Walk       | Aberdeen    |               | AB24 3UE |
| University of Birmingham | Barnes Library                 | Medical School    | Birmingham  | West Midlands | B15 2TT  |
| University of Warwick    | Library                        | Gibbett Hill Road | Coventry    |               | CV4 7AL  |

As well as cleaning your data, OpenRefine can be used to _enhance_ your dataset. An example is if you have a list of names of people which can be linked to records in an external authority, and then related data pulled in from that data source.

| Data you have | Date of Birth from VIAF (Virtual Int. Authority File) | Date of Death from VIAF |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Braddon, M. E. (Mary Elizabeth) |                                1835 |                    1915 |
| Rossetti, William Michael |                                      1829 |                    1919 |
| Prest, Thomas Peckett |                                          1810 |                    1879 |

### What Should I Know When Working With OpenRefine?
* OpenRefine runs in your browser but all data and processes are stored locally
* Any sharing of data or workflows is done via OpenRefine's export/import process
* You are NOT modifying original/raw data. OpenRefine works with a copy
